**Problem 1.4.1: Elon's Money**

Prompt: On October 27th, 2022, Elon Musk purchased Twitter for $44B in total, with reportedly $33B of his own money [(NYT)](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/technology/elon-musk-twitter-deal-complete.html). Since
that time, it appears this investment has not worked out. If Elon had instead bought $44B of 
[US Treasury Bonds](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&field_tdr_date_value=2022), 
how much would his total investments be worth in 10 and 20 years after the bonds expire? Assume the 10-year bonds pay 3.96%,
the 20-year bonds pay 4.32%, with each compounding annually. (Assume these are two hypothetical purchases.)

This problem requires you to calculate compounding interest and final value of a US treasury deposit based upon
current interest rates. Your analysis should be the final value of the investment
after a 10-year and 20-year period. The final values should be stored in the variables "ten_year_final"
and "ten_year_final", respectively. Perform all your calculations in this file. 

Do not perform the calculations by hand and simply write in the final result. 
Use the compounding interest equation (and examples) from class.

**Problem 1.4.2: Duke's Unleashed**

For investments over $1M it can be typically assumed that they will return 5% forever. 
Using the [2022 - 2023 JMU Cost of Attendance](https://www.jmu.edu/financialaid/learn/cost-of-attendance-undergrad.shtml),
calculate how much a rich alumnus would have to give to pay for one full year (all costs) for an in-state student
and an out-of-state student. Store your final answer in the variables: "in_state_gift" and "out_state_gift".

Note: this problem does not require the "compounding interest" formula from the previous problem.
